# dopenapi

A utility for reading an OpenAPI specification and generating a deno client.

This library also contains a type heirarchy for a portion of the OpenAPI spec
which can be used to generate valid OpenAPI specifications.

## Limitations

Clients can be generated for OpenAPI specifications generated by Jsonotron but
will struggle with anything else. It's only intended to support a limited
portion of JSON schema and OpenAPI schema.

The `/components/requestBodies` will not be read. Place all schemas in the
`/components/schemas` node instead.

Each schema in `/components/schemas` must be an object type and should only
contain one level of properties. Each property can be a JSON type (e.g. number,
string, boolean) or a $ref to another schema. Alternatively, a property can be
an 'array' type with the items property set to a JSON type or a $ref to another
schema. The possible options are shown below.

```json
{
  "simple": {
    "type": "number"
  },
  "ref": {
    "$ref": "#/components/schemas/SomeSchema"
  },
  "simpleArray": {
    "type": "array",
    "items": {
      "type": "string"
    }
  },
  "refArray": {
    "type": "array",
    "items": {
      "$ref": "#/components/schemas/SomeSchema"
    }
  }
}
```

Path parameters can only be placed in the parameters property of the path
node, they cannot be placed in the operations such as get or post.  Conversely,
header parameters, query parameters and cookie parameters can only be placed
in the operations.

## Commands

Run `deno task test` to test, format and output coverage report.
